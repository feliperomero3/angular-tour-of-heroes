# Tour of Heroes app and tutorial

![Node.js CI][nodejs-ci-badge]

The Tour of Heroes app that you build helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes. The app has many of the features you'd expect to find in any data-driven application. The finished app acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.
